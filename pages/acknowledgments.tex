    \subsection*{Free software community}
        Simply put, very little of the current work could have been realized without standing on the shoulders of giants, as Isaac Newton said. The giants in this case are the wonderful people beyond some great \emph{free as in freedom} software. My thankfulness goes to all the guys who contributed to realize the computer programs and projects I have relied on: ArchLinux, Debian GNU/Linux, VIM, \LaTeX~and TikZ, GraphViz, GNUPlot, QuantumGIS, GDAL and GEOS, OpenJump, PostGIS, TileMill, OpenStreetMap, tmux, the K Desktop Environment, Python, (geo)Django, Twitter Bootstrap, the Archaeological Recording Kit, Nginx, LeafletJS, PHPMyAdmin, MySQL, InkScape.
